# SignalGenMorse

In this you will find the code for generating morse code with a script, just feed it a sentence and it will generate morse code and save it as an MP3

## Instructions
Open and run libs.py to automatically install the libraries.
  In case there is an error with installation of the libraries open the command prompt and navigate to the directory where the files are, then run: pip install -r libs.txt
    If it still gives an error open libs.txt and try to individually install each module.
      There maybe an issue with compatibility so check online to find the versions of the libraries compatible with Python.

## Generating the beeps
Run GenBeeps.py
That generates two beeps to use with morse code

## Generating the code
Run GenMorse.py
Enter the text
The audio will be saved and played too
